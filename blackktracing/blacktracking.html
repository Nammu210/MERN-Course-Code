        <h1>Backtracking</h1>
        <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
        <p>The usual scenaria is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options: what t of ipyions you get depends on what your choice you made.This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state.If you made a good sequence of choices,your final state is a goal state; if you didn't,it isn't.</p>
        
        <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree;tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, thought it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>    
        
        <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for agood leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next opyion in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at the that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>    
    
        <p>This needs an example.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Starting at Root,your options are A and B. You choose A. </li><br/>
            <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br/>
            <li>At A, you have already tried C,and it failed. Try D.</li><br/>
            <li>D is bad.Go back to A.</li><br/>
            <li>At A,you have no options left to try.Go back to Root.</li><br/>
            <li>At Root,you have already tried A.Try B.</li><br/>
            <li>At B,your options are E and F.Try E.</li><br/>
            <li>E is good Congratulations!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make.There is also a data structure called a tree,but usually we don't have a data structureto tell us what choices we have.(If we do have an actual tree data structure,backtrackon it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>
